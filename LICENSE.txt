The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work and/or Data, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work and/or Data otherwise complies with all the terms and conditions stated in this License;
     (f) With respect to Licensor’s Data, you must cite to Licensor’s research papers – namely, “Diffeomorphic Registration of retinotopic Map” - whether or not such papers are identified in any NOTICE text file accompanying the Data.

6. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in or use with the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate agreement you may have executed or may execute with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
